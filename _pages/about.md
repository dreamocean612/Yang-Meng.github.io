_Ph.D. Student in Mechanical Engineering, University of Georgia_  

Welcome to my academic homepage! I am a Ph.D. Ph.D. Candidate in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Georgia. I work as a researcher in the MODEL group lab under the guidance of Dr. Beshoy Morkos. I obtained my master’s degree from Johns Hopkins University in 2023, focusing mainly on AI and medical robotics. I completed my undergraduate studies at Florida Institute of Technology and WuHan Institute of Technology, graduating with Magna Cum Laude honors. I previously worked at the Fraunhofer Intelligent Manufacturing Center at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I was mainly responsible for weld seam identification and Industry 4.0 research. He is very interested in the application of control theory and AI in various emerging fields. I am also good at musical instruments and have won several awards in the field of the Chinese bamboo flute.
