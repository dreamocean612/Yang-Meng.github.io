# Meng Yang  
_Ph.D. Student in Mechanical Engineering, University of Georgia_  

Welcome to my academic homepage! I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at the **University of Georgia**, working in the **MODEL Lab** on intelligent manufacturing, robotics, and AI-driven automation systems. My research focuses on integrating **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **knowledge graphs (KGs)**, and **robotic control frameworks** to create more adaptive, efficient, and human-aware intelligent manufacturing systems.

My current work includes developing LLM-based reasoning modules for robot control, multimodal sensing fusion (RGB-D, IoT, and perception modules), and KG-driven real-time task adaptation in smart-factory environments.
