_Ph.D. Student in Mechanical Engineering, University of Georgia_  

Welcome to my academic homepage! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the [University of Georgia](https://engineering.uga.edu/schools/ecam/). I work as a researcher in the [MODEL group lab](https://model.uga.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. Beshoy Morkos](https://engineering.uga.edu/team_member/beshoy-morkos/). I obtained my master’s degree from [Johns Hopkins University](https://me.jhu.edu/) in 2023, focusing mainly on AI and medical robotics. I completed my undergraduate studies at [Florida Institute of Technology](https://www.fit.edu/mechanical-and-civil-engineering/) and WuHan Institute of Technology, graduating with Magna Cum Laude honors. I previously worked at the [Fraunhofer Intelligent Manufacturing Center at Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://fpcsm.sjtu.edu.cn/), where I was mainly responsible for weld seam identification and Industry 4.0 research. I am very interested in the application of control theory and AI in various emerging fields. I am also good at musical instruments and have won several awards in the field of the Chinese bamboo flute.
